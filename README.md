A Rust project to connect 2 devices using socket communication and generate a shared key [ Using Diffie-Hellman algorithm ] which can be used to encrypt-decrypt data.
Usage :: 
1. Generate the binary [ Cargo Build ]
2. ./binary {H/C} {PORT ADDRESS} {IP ADDRESS of Target Device}
   
This is a very basic implementation with lots of items being hardcoded. This is just for learning Rust :)
